# Eat-Da-Burger!



Eat-Da-Burger! The ultimate application targeted at urbanite burger gourmands that lets them input the names of all the fanciful burgers they'd like to eat. It was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM. Node and MySql were used to query and route data, and Handlebars was utilized to generate HTML.

HOW TO USE:
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page
* The app will store every burger in the database, whether devoured or not



Technologies Used:
* Handlebars
* Node
* MySQL
* Express
* Javascript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* JSON
* HTML
* CSS
